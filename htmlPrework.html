           <br>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. 
           <br>Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden 
           <br>flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of 
           <br>sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic 
           <br>life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The 
           <br>Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but 
           <br> the Little Blind Text didnâ€™t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.
